pgbot
=====

An IRC bot, written in Clojure.

This is a place where I practice with Clojure libraries and patterns
that I'm interested in. Right now I'm using [core.async] to communicate
between processes, and [Stuart Sierra's reloaded pattern][reloaded] for
application disposability.

There is a fully annotated version on this program's core-typed branch.
I think [core.typed] is pretty incredible, and I can't wait to see where
Ambrose takes it, but for now I've decided to move on without
annotations, for various reasons. Perhaps sooner or later I will start
using them again.
